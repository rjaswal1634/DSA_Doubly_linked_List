This C++ code implements a DoublyLinkedList data structure with various methods for managing and manipulating elements. It also demonstrates its usage with a custom Student class.
The reuirement of the code is listed in the pdf Doubly Linked List while the other pdf explains some part of the deliverable.
Key Features:

Template-based DoublyLinkedList class for flexibility
Copy constructor for deep copying linked lists
deleteItem method to remove all instances of an item
Optimized delete(index) method for efficient deletion
reverse method to reverse the linked list order
search(searchItem) method to find all occurrences of an item
Student class with comparison (operator==) and output (operator<<) capabilities
Demonstration:

The code provides a comprehensive demonstration of the DoublyLinkedList and Student class implementations, showcasing various operations and their outputs through screenshots.
